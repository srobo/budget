summary: Fixings for arena construction

cost: 5.32

  Various fixings for the arena.

  This is enough for about 8 boxes of screws from screwfix (average of
  approximately £2), 300 white screwcaps, and a few hundred cable ties
  (for the attaching of the black fabric to the arena).

  The budget is the same as last year, with a £5 fudge factor.

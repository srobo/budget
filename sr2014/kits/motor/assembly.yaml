  USB motor board assembly.

  All of our motor boards are being replaced with USB motor boards for
  SR2014.

  It has been assumed that there will be less components, both unique
  and total on the v3 motor board compared to the v2 motor board due
  to using the monolithic H-bridge IC.

  Based on a quote obtained from the PCB Train website with 110 parts
  in total and 35 unique BOM lines.

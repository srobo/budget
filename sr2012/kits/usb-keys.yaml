summary: Replacement USB keys

cost: 29.94

description: >-
  These are to replace keys we have lost either due to them being damaged
  or not returned by schools (grrr). We need 3 in order to ship, the others
  are spares. These will be ordered from Misco along with the USB hubs which
  already includes the shipping cost.

  Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be possible to get the exact same USB keys
  we had last year. This is the cost for Kingston Datatraveler G3 8GB sticks.

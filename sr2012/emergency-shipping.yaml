description: >-
  According to the bank data we spent £1494 on shipping last year. This was
  unforeseen at the start of the year. We don't expect to have to ship
  anything this year, but that's what we thought last time; hence 
  'emergency' shipping. We already have the kit to hand out at kickstart so
  any shipping will be of smaller items or replacement boards.
